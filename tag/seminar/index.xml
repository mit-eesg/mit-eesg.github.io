&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over one sextillion watt hours of electricity is consumed around the world
annually - mostly produced and distributed on demand using 100-year-old
technology. There are less than 10,000 central power plants producing most of
this electricity. A primary reliance on this centralized production has left
us with increasingly troublesome issues of significant environmental impact,
transmission losses, geographic social and economic inequities, and the
increasing vulnerability of exposed and unsecured lines to natural and
man-caused disaster damage. In addition, historically, most power systems
simply feed &amp;quot;dumb&amp;quot; loads from hard wired fixed physical grids. But an
increasing focus on clean, fault tolerant, resilient, economical, and efficient
energy use is leading to us to consider transforming these systems to
significantly more interactive ones with the capability of intelligent load
management, storage, decentralized mesh wiring topologies and the employment of
an increasingly diverse set of combined clean generation sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation discusses an expanded role for interconnected distributed
renewable energy microgrids in new mesh networks, based on hybrid use of AC and
DC power. It is posited that connecting power creation to power consumption in
a network of massively distributed microgrids will yield the analogous
capability of an &amp;lsquo;Enernet&amp;rsquo; or electric energy network to power fixed and mobile
loads in the 21st century. The presentation will also introduce the concept of
a transactive energy framework used to enable a combination of economic and
control techniques to manage power flows within the network to optimize
operations and commerce within a multi-tiered arrangement of both public and
private microgrids and macrogrids in a Grid-of-Grids topology.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Inverter-based resources such as solar and storage provide us with more
flexibility in the control of power systems. Through their power electronic
interfaces, complex control functions can be implemented to quickly respond to
changes in the system. Recently, reinforcement learning has emerged as a
popular method to find these nonlinear controllers. The key challenge with a
learning-based approach is that stability and safety constraints are difficult
to enforce on the learned controllers. In this talk, we show how model-based
control theory can be used as useful constraints on reinforcement learning,
allowing us to explicitly engineer the structure of neural network controllers
such that they guarantee system stability. The resulting controllers only use
local information and outperform conventional droop as well as strategies
learned purely by using reinforcement learning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We need to talk about Low Voltage (Low Voltage Load Forecasting: Methods, Applications, and Recommendations)</title><link>https://eesg.mit.edu/eesg_seminar/2022-03-02-haben-greetham/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eesg.mit.edu/eesg_seminar/2022-03-02-haben-greetham/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The ways electricity is produced and consumed are changing at an extraordinary pace in comparison to the rate at which electricity networks can evolve. At the same time, network design approaches and technologies are artifacts of engineering decisions taken under vastly different sets of assumptions. The most potent example of such an artifact is the assumption that all generation involves some kind of rotating mass turning at synchronous speed. If now we were to reset our assumption base and redesign transmission and distribution networks from scratch, how would they look like (in terms of topology, ratings, etc.)? How would they be controlled? The answers to these questions could serve industry well by providing upper bounds on the performance of network designs. Moreover, they could provide guides for migrating our current networks towards better performing ones. In this talk, we will outline some of our initial findings and plans to address these questions.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Demand flexibility and its responsiveness under price-based control is a major research field. Much attention has been paid to model demand elasticity as synonymous with demand flexibility. But demand flexibility comes mostly as load shifting, and load shifting dynamics have been neglected when modelling demand response. In this talk, we will show the results of modeling basic load shifting dynamics with a particle hopping cellular automaton (CA), and interpret such results to derive response intrinsic limitations from direct control of such loads. We will then look at dynamics from indirect price-based control focusing on the hysteresis of the price-response characteristic and on the difficulties, hysteresis imposes to control. We will finally use the CA to model plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) battery discharge capabilities of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies and discuss the value added to PEV aggregators by evolving from ordinary load-shifting into V2G responsive services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flexibility Auctions A Framework for Managing Imbalance Risk</title><link>https://eesg.mit.edu/eesg_seminar/2021-11-17-hytowitz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eesg.mit.edu/eesg_seminar/2021-11-17-hytowitz/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Today, flexibility from a limited number of distributed energy resources (DERs) is offered in wholesale electricity markets, and the value of flexibility is not yet recognized for economic hedging of delivery risk. Under a three-year project funded by the ARPA-E PERFORM program, our team is working towards developing an integrated risk management framework that will leverage flexibility from distributed and bulk resources to cost-effectively and reliably manage delivery risk of intermittent resources. Two concepts are at the core of the proposed integrated risk management framework:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(A) flexibility options, which are a novel type of options and enable wholesale electricity market participants to hedge uncertainty by buying flexibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(B) DER flexibility scores, which provide a way for utilities or aggregators to classify assets in groups with different likelihood of delivering contracted flexibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation will focus on the proposed ISO-product “flexibility options”, which is complementary to ramp and other products being introduced by ISOs/RTOs to manage net load uncertainties. Participating resources with imbalanced risk can buy flexibility options to hedge their production, whereas grid-connected resources that can provide physical flexibility can offer flexibility options. We will present basics of the formulation for a day-ahead ISO market that matches buyers and sellers of this hedge in coordination with existing capabilities to schedule energy and ancillary services, and outline how their settlements mitigate the impact of imbalance risk.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This MIT seminar presentation will summarize the historical blackouts starting with the great 1965 Northeast blackout with emphasis on engineering and control system failures. It will include a summary of the near miss polar vortex of 2014 and the two big freeze Texas outages including the February 15, 2021, rotating outage. Clearly power engineering is not rocket science &amp;mdash; it is much more important than that&amp;mdash; with loss of life risk and economic shutdowns. As we move to more asynchronous generation there is a need for hybrid AC/DC transmission and distribution. Going forward we must look at the weather extremes as well as how to use the speed of power electronics and storage for synthetic inertia to substitute for the rotating mass that the system historically counted on to ride through disturbances.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When fossil fuels are phased out from our cities, two remaining types of networks will dominate the energy distribution; electrical and thermal networks. For optimal efficiency the two network types need to be tightly intertwined. This seminar will focus on load modeling and control, illustrated from the perspective of thermal networks. How do we model and predict the energy needs of buildings in order to shave the peaks in energy consumption? How do we control the pressure in thermal networks for a fair distribution to customers at times of maximum load? Hourly data collected from residential buildings in southern Sweden for more than a year give a very good basis for modeling and validation.

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As inverter-based resources displace power generation from conventional synchronous machines, power system transient dynamics evolve from being dominated by electromechanical and electromagnetic phenomena to also including human-engineered control loops embedded within power electronic converters. How will these new control loops change the way power system engineers assess and plan for power system stability? This talk seeks to provide some answers to these questions by re-examining some of the assumptions we typically make when evaluating power system stability. I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss some of our recent work examining the role of line dynamics and dc-side converter modeling on power system stability, and discuss some paths forward for modeling and control design.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The past century has witnessed a digitization trend of electric power grid where increasing digital solutions are being integrated into the grid infrastructure. The digital solutions not only provide opportunities for enhancing monitoring, control and protection of the power grid, but also pose challenges of ensuring both cyber and physical security of the grid. This presentation provides two concrete examples in order to leverage the emerging opportunities and to address pressing challenges in a massively digitized grid. By using rich streaming synchrophasor data in bulk power transmission systems, a purely data-driven algorithm is presented in order to locate sources of forced oscillations. In order to address physical security issues from distributed generation resources and power electronic interfaces in distribution systems, a learning-based framework is designed for assessing physical security of networked microgrids. Furthermore, an advanced energy management system for future digitized power grids is envisioned and thereby future research directions are pointed out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many countries have implemented renewables portfolio standards (RPSs) to accelerate the pace of the renewables generation deployment, which are distributed across the electric power system. As the penetration of the renewable power energy resources increases, in order to avoid unnecessary power system upgrades, Grid Enhancing Technologies (GET) are being deployed to maximize the utilization of the electric power system capacity, to control the power flow in transmission lines, and to improve the management of the health of the existing power system asset. This seminar will present some examples of the GET technologies that are currently being demonstrated by the utilities. The challenges associated with these technologies along with open problems/research areas will also be discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This talk will demystify the slack bus. The notion of the slack bus has been shrouded in confusion to varying degrees in power-system analysis. We will see that this is largely due to how power-flow problem formulations never quite kept up with industry practices. The talk will also formalize the idea of a distributed slack bus that provides high-accuracy power-flow solutions leveraging connections between the dynamics of synchronous generators, economic dispatch, and automatic generation control. We will end with a few pointers for how power-flow problems will have to be revisited in future grids with increased inverter-based resources.&lt;/p>
