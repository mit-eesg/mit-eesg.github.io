&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over one sextillion watt hours of electricity is consumed around the world
annually - mostly produced and distributed on demand using 100-year-old
technology. There are less than 10,000 central power plants producing most of
this electricity. A primary reliance on this centralized production has left
us with increasingly troublesome issues of significant environmental impact,
transmission losses, geographic social and economic inequities, and the
increasing vulnerability of exposed and unsecured lines to natural and
man-caused disaster damage. In addition, historically, most power systems
simply feed &amp;quot;dumb&amp;quot; loads from hard wired fixed physical grids. But an
increasing focus on clean, fault tolerant, resilient, economical, and efficient
energy use is leading to us to consider transforming these systems to
significantly more interactive ones with the capability of intelligent load
management, storage, decentralized mesh wiring topologies and the employment of
an increasingly diverse set of combined clean generation sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation discusses an expanded role for interconnected distributed
renewable energy microgrids in new mesh networks, based on hybrid use of AC and
DC power. It is posited that connecting power creation to power consumption in
a network of massively distributed microgrids will yield the analogous
capability of an &amp;lsquo;Enernet&amp;rsquo; or electric energy network to power fixed and mobile
loads in the 21st century. The presentation will also introduce the concept of
a transactive energy framework used to enable a combination of economic and
control techniques to manage power flows within the network to optimize
operations and commerce within a multi-tiered arrangement of both public and
private microgrids and macrogrids in a Grid-of-Grids topology.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Inverter-based resources such as solar and storage provide us with more
flexibility in the control of power systems. Through their power electronic
interfaces, complex control functions can be implemented to quickly respond to
changes in the system. Recently, reinforcement learning has emerged as a
popular method to find these nonlinear controllers. The key challenge with a
learning-based approach is that stability and safety constraints are difficult
to enforce on the learned controllers. In this talk, we show how model-based
control theory can be used as useful constraints on reinforcement learning,
allowing us to explicitly engineer the structure of neural network controllers
such that they guarantee system stability. The resulting controllers only use
local information and outperform conventional droop as well as strategies
learned purely by using reinforcement learning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We need to talk about Low Voltage (Low Voltage Load Forecasting: Methods, Applications, and Recommendations)</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/eesg_seminar/2022-03-02-haben-greetham/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/eesg_seminar/2022-03-02-haben-greetham/</guid><description>

&lt;p>To that end, Ilic, a senior research scientist in MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decisions Systems (LIDS) and a senior staff member at Lincoln Laboratory in the Energy Systems Group, designed an MITx course, delivered through edX, that captures her methods and vision: &lt;a href="https://www.edx.org/course/principles-of-modeling-simulations-and-control-for-electric-energy-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Principles of Modeling, Simulation, and Control for Electric Energy Systems&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The course starts with fundamental concepts in electric power systems operations and management, and it steadily adds layers of complexity, posing real-world problems along the way. Ilic explains how voltage travels from point to point across transmission lines and how grid managers modulate systems to ensure that enough, but not too much, electricity flows. “To deliver power from one location to the next one, operators must constantly make adjustments to ensure that the receiving end can handle the voltage transmitted, optimizing voltage to avoid overheating the wires,” she says.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the end of the course, approximatelly 2000 enrolled students, were invited to pursue independent research projects. Some have modeled the impact of a new energy source on a local grid or for example investigated different options for reducing energy loss in transmission lines.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The ways electricity is produced and consumed are changing at an extraordinary pace in comparison to the rate at which electricity networks can evolve. At the same time, network design approaches and technologies are artifacts of engineering decisions taken under vastly different sets of assumptions. The most potent example of such an artifact is the assumption that all generation involves some kind of rotating mass turning at synchronous speed. If now we were to reset our assumption base and redesign transmission and distribution networks from scratch, how would they look like (in terms of topology, ratings, etc.)? How would they be controlled? The answers to these questions could serve industry well by providing upper bounds on the performance of network designs. Moreover, they could provide guides for migrating our current networks towards better performing ones. In this talk, we will outline some of our initial findings and plans to address these questions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Demand flexibility and its responsiveness under price-based control is a major research field. Much attention has been paid to model demand elasticity as synonymous with demand flexibility. But demand flexibility comes mostly as load shifting, and load shifting dynamics have been neglected when modelling demand response. In this talk, we will show the results of modeling basic load shifting dynamics with a particle hopping cellular automaton (CA), and interpret such results to derive response intrinsic limitations from direct control of such loads. We will then look at dynamics from indirect price-based control focusing on the hysteresis of the price-response characteristic and on the difficulties, hysteresis imposes to control. We will finally use the CA to model plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) battery discharge capabilities of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies and discuss the value added to PEV aggregators by evolving from ordinary load-shifting into V2G responsive services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Distributed energy control in electric energy systems</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/preprint-2021-distributed-energy-control-electric-energy-systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/preprint-2021-distributed-energy-control-electric-energy-systems/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Microgrid Operation and Control: Challenges and expected functionalities</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/preprint-2021-control-residential-hvac-limited-sensing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/preprint-2021-control-residential-hvac-limited-sensing/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Flexibility Auctions A Framework for Managing Imbalance Risk</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/eesg_seminar/2021-11-17-hytowitz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/eesg_seminar/2021-11-17-hytowitz/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Today, flexibility from a limited number of distributed energy resources (DERs) is offered in wholesale electricity markets, and the value of flexibility is not yet recognized for economic hedging of delivery risk. Under a three-year project funded by the ARPA-E PERFORM program, our team is working towards developing an integrated risk management framework that will leverage flexibility from distributed and bulk resources to cost-effectively and reliably manage delivery risk of intermittent resources. Two concepts are at the core of the proposed integrated risk management framework:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(A) flexibility options, which are a novel type of options and enable wholesale electricity market participants to hedge uncertainty by buying flexibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(B) DER flexibility scores, which provide a way for utilities or aggregators to classify assets in groups with different likelihood of delivering contracted flexibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation will focus on the proposed ISO-product “flexibility options”, which is complementary to ramp and other products being introduced by ISOs/RTOs to manage net load uncertainties. Participating resources with imbalanced risk can buy flexibility options to hedge their production, whereas grid-connected resources that can provide physical flexibility can offer flexibility options. We will present basics of the formulation for a day-ahead ISO market that matches buyers and sellers of this hedge in coordination with existing capabilities to schedule energy and ancillary services, and outline how their settlements mitigate the impact of imbalance risk.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This MIT seminar presentation will summarize the historical blackouts starting with the great 1965 Northeast blackout with emphasis on engineering and control system failures. It will include a summary of the near miss polar vortex of 2014 and the two big freeze Texas outages including the February 15, 2021, rotating outage. Clearly power engineering is not rocket science &amp;mdash; it is much more important than that&amp;mdash; with loss of life risk and economic shutdowns. As we move to more asynchronous generation there is a need for hybrid AC/DC transmission and distribution. Going forward we must look at the weather extremes as well as how to use the speed of power electronics and storage for synthetic inertia to substitute for the rotating mass that the system historically counted on to ride through disturbances.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When fossil fuels are phased out from our cities, two remaining types of networks will dominate the energy distribution; electrical and thermal networks. For optimal efficiency the two network types need to be tightly intertwined. This seminar will focus on load modeling and control, illustrated from the perspective of thermal networks. How do we model and predict the energy needs of buildings in order to shave the peaks in energy consumption? How do we control the pressure in thermal networks for a fair distribution to customers at times of maximum load? Hourly data collected from residential buildings in southern Sweden for more than a year give a very good basis for modeling and validation. We will also review some relevant recent results on optimal distributed control of network flows.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As inverter-based resources displace power generation from conventional synchronous machines, power system transient dynamics evolve from being dominated by electromechanical and electromagnetic phenomena to also including human-engineered control loops embedded within power electronic converters. How will these new control loops change the way power system engineers assess and plan for power system stability? This talk seeks to provide some answers to these questions by re-examining some of the assumptions we typically make when evaluating power system stability. I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss some of our recent work examining the role of line dynamics and dc-side converter modeling on power system stability, and discuss some paths forward for modeling and control design.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The past century has witnessed a digitization trend of electric power grid where increasing digital solutions are being integrated into the grid infrastructure. The digital solutions not only provide opportunities for enhancing monitoring, control and protection of the power grid, but also pose challenges of ensuring both cyber and physical security of the grid. This presentation provides two concrete examples in order to leverage the emerging opportunities and to address pressing challenges in a massively digitized grid. By using rich streaming synchrophasor data in bulk power transmission systems, a purely data-driven algorithm is presented in order to locate sources of forced oscillations. In order to address physical security issues from distributed generation resources and power electronic interfaces in distribution systems, a learning-based framework is designed for assessing physical security of networked microgrids. Furthermore, an advanced energy management system for future digitized power grids is envisioned and thereby future research directions are pointed out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many countries have implemented renewables portfolio standards (RPSs) to accelerate the pace of the renewables generation deployment, which are distributed across the electric power system. As the penetration of the renewable power energy resources increases, in order to avoid unnecessary power system upgrades, Grid Enhancing Technologies (GET) are being deployed to maximize the utilization of the electric power system capacity, to control the power flow in transmission lines, and to improve the management of the health of the existing power system asset. This seminar will present some examples of the GET technologies that are currently being demonstrated by the utilities. The challenges associated with these technologies along with open problems/research areas will also be discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This talk will demystify the slack bus. The notion of the slack bus has been shrouded in confusion to varying degrees in power-system analysis. We will see that this is largely due to how power-flow problem formulations never quite kept up with industry practices. The talk will also formalize the idea of a distributed slack bus that provides high-accuracy power-flow solutions leveraging connections between the dynamics of synchronous generators, economic dispatch, and automatic generation control. We will end with a few pointers for how power-flow problems will have to be revisited in future grids with increased inverter-based resources.&lt;/p>

fundamental risk tools from economics to balance uncertain supply and demand in
the electricity sector and improve adoption of renewable energy sources. This
critical infrastructure sector virtually affects everybody in the US, and is a
cornerstone of the efforts to make a transition to a low carbon economy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditionally, the grid relies on conventional bulk power plants to provide the
flexibility to operate power systems reliably. These assets can guarantee
available capacity except in rare events. The existing risk management strategy
protects against those rare events and aligns well with conventional
technologies. New risk management strategies are needed due to the shift in
grid resources: variable renewable resources, distributed energy resources, and
storage technologies. Management systems must be able to leverage all
capabilities of these new technologies to maintain an economical and reliable
grid. PERFORM projects aim to address that need by developing methods to
quantify and manage risk at the asset and system levels for the grid.&lt;/p>

It is a one-directional structure, with the energy plants being the only source of power for many end users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, however, electricity can be generated from many and varied sources — and move through the system in multiple directions. An electric power system may include stands of huge turbines capturing wild ocean winds, for instance. There might be solar farms of a hundred megawatts or more, or houses with solar panels on their roofs that some days make more electricity than occupants need, some days much less. And there are electric cars, their batteries hoarding stored energy overnight. Users may draw electricity from one source or another, or feed it back into the system, all at the same time. Add to that the trend toward open electricity markets, where end users like households can pick and choose the electricity services they buy depending on their needs. How should systems operators integrate all these while keeping the grid stable and ensuring power gets to where it is needed?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To explore this question, Ilic has developed a new way to model complex power systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Electric power systems, even traditional ones, are complex and heterogeneous to begin with. They cover wide geographical areas and have legal and political barriers to contend with, such as state borders and energy policies. In addition, all electric power systems have inherent physical limitations. For instance, power does not flow in a set path in an electric grid, but rather along all possible paths connecting supply to demand. To maintain grid stability and quality of service, then, the system must control for the impact of interconnections: a change in supply and demand at one point in a system changes supply and demand for the other points in the system. This means there is much more complexity to manage as new sources of energy (more interconnections) with sometimes unpredictable supply (such as wind or solar power) come into play. Ultimately, however, to maintain stability and quality of service, and to balance supply and demand within the system, it comes down to a relatively simple concept: the power consumed and the rate at which it is consumed (plus whatever is lost along the way), must always equal the power produced and the rate at which it is produced.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interactive protocols for distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS)</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/journal-2020-interactive-protocols-for-der/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/journal-2020-interactive-protocols-for-der/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Provision of Differentiated Reliability Services Under a Market-Based Investment Decision Making</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/journal-2020-provision-of-differentiated-reliability/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/journal-2020-provision-of-differentiated-reliability/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Unified value-based feedback, optimization and risk management in complex electric energy systems</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/paper-2020-unfied-value-based-feedback-complex-energy-systems/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/paper-2020-unfied-value-based-feedback-complex-energy-systems/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fundamentals of Modeling and Control for the Evolving Electric Power System Architectures (EAGER)</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/project/eager/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/project/eager/</guid><description>&lt;!-- # Your project description goes here.

&lt;p>The main objective of this project is to formalize ground-breaking general
principles in support of investment planning and operating protocols for the
changing electric energy systems. This is crucial for assessing effects
of candidate hardware and software technologies and for creating an environment
in which flexible technologies are utilized by complementing each others'
performance and by jointly meeting societal needs. Since the performance of
many technologies of interest greatly depends on how well they are integrated
over time and stakeholders (system modules), an effective framework needs to
support decisions that are data-enabled and interactive over time and among
different system decision makers. In this project a complex dynamical systems
point of view is taken which recognizes such distributed nature of decisions
and introduces novel modeling, control and protocol principles in support of
system integration in time and space. In sharp contrast with the lack of
theoretically-provable performance in the evolving electric power system
architectures, this project explores fundamentals and takes major steps toward
solving this long-overdue problem. The most important impact will be on the way
electric power industry architectures evolve. In particular, the project will
catalyze the adoption of data-enabled decision making and automation. Notably,
this approach will help educate students to think about emerging electric
energy systems as complex dynamical systems for which much innovation is needed
and possible. Results of this research will be disseminated through a workshop
on design and control of complex energy systems.&lt;/p>

Systems (DyMoNDS) framework for IT-enabled engineering of end-to-end retail
level energy services. The main architecture of interest is a fully
integrated retail level energy service system for enhanced efficient, clean and
reliable energy services. The key role is to learn end users’ needs,
characteristics of the diverse distributed energy resources and to align their
interactions through IT-enabled protocols on-line. Moreover, the integrators
can also become a “provider of the last resource” to its end users, much the
same way as the large utility is today. They plan and invest into new
technologies for energy efficiency and quality of service to end users,
establish long-term contracts at well-defined value.&lt;/p>

end-devices respond versus when they do not, decreases significantly. As a
result, the wear-and-tear of the fast units reduce significantly and more
importantly, the need for these expensive units can be minimized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal of the project is to utilize the flexibility offered by an aggregate
of distributed energy resources including water heaters, electric vehicles,
batteries, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) units. These
aggregates close to end-users are referred to as Network Optimized Distributed
Energy Resources (NODES). We utilize the notion of DyMonDS to better utilize
the end-user flexibility in light of the local uncertainties as well as the
uncertainties in price.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unified Modeling for Emulating Electric Energy Systems: Toward Digital Twin that Might Work</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/reference_books/unified-modeling-for-emulating-electric-energy-systems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/reference_books/unified-modeling-for-emulating-electric-energy-systems/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Modeling and Distributed Control of Microgrids: A Negative Feedback Approach</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/paper-2019-modeling-distributed-control-microgrids/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/paper-2019-modeling-distributed-control-microgrids/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Toward Distributed Control for Autonomous Electrical Energy Systems</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/thesis-miao/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/thesis-miao/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Secure Monitoring and Control of Solar PV Systems through Dynamic Watermarking</title><link>https://mit-eesg.github.io/project/watermarking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2019 12:52:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://mit-eesg.github.io/project/watermarking/</guid><description>&lt;p>This project will develop and demonstrate an active defense mechanism of
cyber-resilient PV distribution system operation using a dynamic watermarking
technique to monitor cybersecurity. The technique involves injecting a probe
signal onto the grid to authenticate grid actions. The approach will include
the real-time deployment of online computational algorithms in real-world
critical locations. Partners include researchers from MIT, Texas A&amp;amp;M
University, CenterPoint Energy, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and the
Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). The MIT team will develop corrective
control algorithms to mitigate the negative impact of cyber attacks. The figure
below presents the topology of a test microgrid with the secondary control. The
secondary controller aims to regulate voltage magnitude and frequency at one
bus of the microgrid by tuning the setpoints of all inverters. An attacker can
compromise the microgrid by maliciously manipulating the telemetered
measurements feeding the secondary controller. If it happens, all decisions
made by the secondary controller will be wrong. To enhance the cyber resilience
of the microgrid, key questions include: 1) how to detect the cyber attacks;
and 2) how to mitigate the negative impacts of cyber attacks if the attacks are
detected. The project teams leverage a dynamic watermarking approach to detect
the cyber attacks. The MIT team are designing an observer-based approach for
taking corrective actions once attacks are detected. With the proposed
corrective controller, critical electrical variables can still be regulated in
the presence of cyber attacks.&lt;/p>

SEPSS. This platform builds on an earlier TCP/IP based multi-layered
interactive computer platform named Smart Grid in a Room Simulator (SGRS)
developed in collaboration with NIST. Each user can define its own system
architecture comprising modules that have uniform functional characterization
such that the interactions can happen across multiple spatial and temporal
layers simultaneously. Given this, SEPSS can emulate hybrid system dynamics
driven by different inputs (weather, consumer preferences) and market
decisions. Both Centralized and Distributed Automated Modeling of Power Systems
(CAMPS, DAMPS) are possible. DAMPS is particularly well-suited for simulating
utility scale systems and markets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We demonstrate the basic Transactive Energy Market (TEM) concepts on truncated
IEEE-8500 test system and some missing market signals. We then show potential
benefits on MIT-LL microgrid test systems from having more detailed market
signals such as voltage and power ramp rates.&lt;/p>
