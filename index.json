Governments are now seeking to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, meaning energy-related CO2 emissions need to get to zero before then, and power systems emissions before then. This is leading to a urgent and radical change with a focus on energy efficiency, renewable electricity and electrification. This presentation focuses on some of the modelling challenges that this poses, and some of the hot topics currently providing solutions. The presentation will draw on research focusing on Ireland (a small synchronous power system that is now integrating up to 75% instantaneous non-synchronous, variable renewable electricity and facing the risk of electricity supply shortages this winter), the European Union (which has seen significant growth in renewable energy and is currently facing the combined risk of gas supply shortages and low power plant availability) and global analysis (using power systems modelling to ‘sense check’ results from the Integrated Assessment Models that are informing climate policies). It will also touch on some of the current developments emerging from the International Energy Agency Technology Collaboration Programme on energy systems modelling (IEA-ETSAP).\n","date":1664222400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664222400,"objectID":"4f205ebdec5fe7152f45b0b7a18349a8","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/event/2022-09-26-brian-o-gallachoir/","publishdate":"2022-09-26T16:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/event/2022-09-26-brian-o-gallachoir/","section":"event","summary":"Prof. Brian Ó Gallachóir, University College Cork and Ireland's MaREI's Research Center for Energy, Climate, and Marine","tags":null,"title":"Invited talk: Modelling energy systems with high levels of renewable electricity and electrification of heat and transport","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Senior Research Scientist Marija Ilic has been elected an IFAC Fellow.

Transition","type":"eesg_seminar"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Abstract Over one sextillion watt hours of electricity is consumed around the world annually - mostly produced and distributed on demand using 100-year-old technology. There are less than 10,000 central power plants producing most of this electricity. A primary reliance on this centralized production has left us with increasingly troublesome issues of significant environmental impact, transmission losses, geographic social and economic inequities, and the increasing vulnerability of exposed and unsecured lines to natural and man-caused disaster damage. In addition, historically, most power systems simply feed \u0026#34;dumb\u0026#34; loads from hard wired fixed physical grids. But an increasing focus on clean, fault tolerant, resilient, economical, and efficient energy use is leading to us to consider transforming these systems to significantly more interactive ones with the capability of intelligent load management, storage, decentralized mesh wiring topologies and the employment of an increasingly diverse set of combined clean generation sources.\nThis presentation discusses an expanded role for interconnected distributed renewable energy microgrids in new mesh networks, based on hybrid use of AC and DC power. It is posited that connecting power creation to power consumption in a network of massively distributed microgrids will yield the analogous capability of an ‘Enernet’ or electric energy network to power fixed and mobile loads in the 21st century. The presentation will also introduce the concept of a transactive energy framework used to enable a combination of economic and control techniques to manage power flows within the network to optimize operations and commerce within a multi-tiered arrangement of both public and private microgrids and macrogrids in a Grid-of-Grids topology.\nBio Brian T.

Through their power electronic interfaces, complex control functions can be implemented to quickly respond to changes in the system. Recently, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular method to find these nonlinear controllers. The key challenge with a learning-based approach is that stability and safety constraints are difficult to enforce on the learned controllers. In this talk, we show how model-based control theory can be used as useful constraints on reinforcement learning, allowing us to explicitly engineer the structure of neural network controllers such that they guarantee system stability. The resulting controllers only use local information and outperform conventional droop as well as strategies learned purely by using reinforcement learning.\n","date":1646751600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646751600,"objectID":"293964c26c5c81f41a501695331c9adc","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/eesg_seminar/2022-03-08-baosen/","publishdate":"2022-03-08T16:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eesg_seminar/2022-03-08-baosen/","section":"eesg_seminar","summary":"Prof. Baosen Zhang","tags":["seminar","Changing Electric Energy Systems","2022 spring"],"title":"Safe and Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Energy Systems","type":"eesg_seminar"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1646179200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646179200,"objectID":"c3ea19a9e4a7194dac1cb239c9de8520","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/eesg_seminar/2022-03-02-haben-greetham/","publishdate":"2022-02-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eesg_seminar/2022-03-02-haben-greetham/","section":"eesg_seminar","summary":"Dr. Stephen Haben (Oxford) and Dr. Danica Vukadinović Greetham (Capgemini Engineering)","tags":["seminar","Changing Electric Energy Systems","2022 spring"],"title":"We need to talk about Low Voltage (Low Voltage Load Forecasting: Methods, Applications, and Recommendations)","type":"eesg_seminar"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1644969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644969600,"objectID":"4b741f8693eb9aa0567ea6f58c0b8948","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/eesg_seminar/2022-02-16-lu/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T16:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eesg_seminar/2022-02-16-lu/","section":"eesg_seminar","summary":"Dr. Ning Lu (North Carolina State University)","tags":["seminar","Changing Electric Energy Systems","2022 spring"],"title":"Development of the Photovoltaic (PV) Analysis and Response Support (PARS) platform","type":"eesg_seminar"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1644364800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644364800,"objectID":"8727ae786a32a7261a1ff95dec6063f8","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/eesg_seminar/2022-02-09-kothari/","publishdate":"2022-02-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eesg_seminar/2022-02-09-kothari/","section":"eesg_seminar","summary":"Dr. D.

Ilic explains how voltage travels from point to point across transmission lines and how grid managers modulate systems to ensure that enough, but not too much, electricity flows. “To deliver power from one location to the next one, operators must constantly make adjustments to ensure that the receiving end can handle the voltage transmitted, optimizing voltage to avoid overheating the wires,” she says.\nBy the end of the course, approximatelly 2000 enrolled students, were invited to pursue independent research projects. Some have modeled the impact of a new energy source on a local grid or for example investigated different options for reducing energy loss in transmission lines.\nhttps://news.mit.edu/2022/preparing-global-online-learners-clean-energy-transition-0131\n","date":1643587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643587200,"objectID":"21f7a01052e8163c99f28b2343e61c85","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/post/2022-01-31-marija-edx/","publishdate":"2022-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-01-31-marija-edx/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Preparing global online learners for the clean energy transition","type":"post"},{"authors":["Tong Huang","Sicun Gao","Le Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642204800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642204800,"objectID":"614c60643f6863d663f6f79483a4f834","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/journal-2022-neural-lyapunov-approach/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-2022-neural-lyapunov-approach/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Neural Lyapunov Approach to Transient Stability Assessment of Power Electronics-Interfaced Networked Microgrids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tong Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"f3941d36a00bcafd7de061d65ef5ca29","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/presentation/2022-anomaly-management-massively-digitized-power-systems/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/2022-anomaly-management-massively-digitized-power-systems/","section":"presentation","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Anomaly Management in Massively Digitized Power Systems","type":"presentation"},{"authors":["Premila Rowles"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"20ffba7f2ab6e998ff72d1b62cea1cdd","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/thesis-rowles/","publishdate":"2022-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis-rowles/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Implementation of cybersecure observers and control in microgrids; energy dynamics based approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marija Ilic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"5a0b9834edee29b10c2f3cbe08349d15","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/reference_books/interaction-variables-based-modeling/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/reference_books/interaction-variables-based-modeling/","section":"reference_books","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Interaction Variables-based Modeling and Control of Energy Dynamics (to appear in Women in Power: Research and Development Advances in Electric Power Systems)","type":"reference_books"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Abstract This session will discuss some of the game changing technologies that can modernize our energy grid including blockchain, federated machine learning, alternative direct current technology, embedded encryption, tokenization, intelligent digital twins, peer to peer trading and AI edge processing.

At the same time, network design approaches and technologies are artifacts of engineering decisions taken under vastly different sets of assumptions. The most potent example of such an artifact is the assumption that all generation involves some kind of rotating mass turning at synchronous speed. If now we were to reset our assumption base and redesign transmission and distribution networks from scratch, how would they look like (in terms of topology, ratings, etc.)? How would they be controlled? The answers to these questions could serve industry well by providing upper bounds on the performance of network designs. Moreover, they could provide guides for migrating our current networks towards better performing ones.

Under a three-year project funded by the ARPA-E PERFORM program, our team is working towards developing an integrated risk management framework that will leverage flexibility from distributed and bulk resources to cost-effectively and reliably manage delivery risk of intermittent resources. Two concepts are at the core of the proposed integrated risk management framework:\n(A) flexibility options, which are a novel type of options and enable wholesale electricity market participants to hedge uncertainty by buying flexibility.\n(B) DER flexibility scores, which provide a way for utilities or aggregators to classify assets in groups with different likelihood of delivering contracted flexibility.\nThis presentation will focus on the proposed ISO-product “flexibility options”, which is complementary to ramp and other products being introduced by ISOs/RTOs to manage net load uncertainties. Participating resources with imbalanced risk can buy flexibility options to hedge their production, whereas grid-connected resources that can provide physical flexibility can offer flexibility options. We will present basics of the formulation for a day-ahead ISO market that matches buyers and sellers of this hedge in coordination with existing capabilities to schedule energy and ancillary services, and outline how their settlements mitigate the impact of imbalance risk.\nBio Dr. Robin Broder Hytowitz is a senior project engineer in Grid Operations and Planning at the Electric Power Research Institute.\nAt EPRI, she focuses on wholesale market design and operations, supply resilience, and renewable integration.

As the penetration of the renewable power energy resources increases, in order to avoid unnecessary power system upgrades, Grid Enhancing Technologies (GET) are being deployed to maximize the utilization of the electric power system capacity, to control the power flow in transmission lines, and to improve the management of the health of the existing power system asset. This seminar will present some examples of the GET technologies that are currently being demonstrated by the utilities. The challenges associated with these technologies along with open problems/research areas will also be discussed.\nBios Babak Enayati received his PhD in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University, USA in 2009.

The notion of the slack bus has been shrouded in confusion to varying degrees in power-system analysis. We will see that this is largely due to how power-flow problem formulations never quite kept up with industry practices. The talk will also formalize the idea of a distributed slack bus that provides high-accuracy power-flow solutions leveraging connections between the dynamics of synchronous generators, economic dispatch, and automatic generation control. We will end with a few pointers for how power-flow problems will have to be revisited in future grids with increased inverter-based resources.\nBios Dr. Sairaj Dhople is currently serving as Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota.

It is a one-directional structure, with the energy plants being the only source of power for many end users.\nToday, however, electricity can be generated from many and varied sources — and move through the system in multiple directions. An electric power system may include stands of huge turbines capturing wild ocean winds, for instance. There might be solar farms of a hundred megawatts or more, or houses with solar panels on their roofs that some days make more electricity than occupants need, some days much less. And there are electric cars, their batteries hoarding stored energy overnight. Users may draw electricity from one source or another, or feed it back into the system, all at the same time. Add to that the trend toward open electricity markets, where end users like households can pick and choose the electricity services they buy depending on their needs. How should systems operators integrate all these while keeping the grid stable and ensuring power gets to where it is needed?\nTo explore this question, Ilic has developed a new way to model complex power systems.\nElectric power systems, even traditional ones, are complex and heterogeneous to begin with. They cover wide geographical areas and have legal and political barriers to contend with, such as state borders and energy policies. In addition, all electric power systems have inherent physical limitations. For instance, power does not flow in a set path in an electric grid, but rather along all possible paths connecting supply to demand. To maintain grid stability and quality of service, then, the system must control for the impact of interconnections: a change in supply and demand at one point in a system changes supply and demand for the other points in the system. This means there is much more complexity to manage as new sources of energy (more interconnections) with sometimes unpredictable supply (such as wind or solar power) come into play. Ultimately, however, to maintain stability and quality of service, and to balance supply and demand within the system, it comes down to a relatively simple concept: the power consumed and the rate at which it is consumed (plus whatever is lost along the way), must always equal the power produced and the rate at which it is produced.\n","date":15876e5,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":15876e5,"objectID":"313755b405d260da680bc03f2ff42e1c","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/post/2020-04-23-marija-mit-news/","publishdate":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-04-23-marija-mit-news/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Shedding light on complex power systems","type":"post"},{"authors":["Marija Ilic","Rupamathi Jaddivada","Magnus Korpas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587513600,"objectID":"c93e174fb2b2960effc486c95bcde918","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/journal-2020-interactive-protocols-for-der/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-2020-interactive-protocols-for-der/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Interactive protocols for distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siripha Junlakarn","Marija Ilic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586304e3,"objectID":"c1a4b36eedf698f430ff513c26678b54","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/journal-2020-provision-of-differentiated-reliability/","publishdate":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-2020-provision-of-differentiated-reliability/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Provision of Differentiated Reliability Services Under a Market-Based Investment Decision Making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marija Ilic","Rupamathi Jaddivada"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582329600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582329600,"objectID":"5080ce623535c076e2d71eadf904cfb0","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/publication/paper-2020-unfied-value-based-feedback-complex-energy-systems/","publishdate":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paper-2020-unfied-value-based-feedback-complex-energy-systems/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Unified value-based feedback, optimization and risk management in complex electric energy systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marija Ilic"],"categories":null,"content":" The main objective of this project is to formalize ground-breaking general principles in support of investment planning and operating protocols for the changing electric energy systems. This is crucial for assessing effects of candidate hardware and software technologies and for creating an environment in which flexible technologies are utilized by complementing each others\u0026#39; performance and by jointly meeting societal needs. Since the performance of many technologies of interest greatly depends on how well they are integrated over time and stakeholders (system modules), an effective framework needs to support decisions that are data-enabled and interactive over time and among different system decision makers. In this project a complex dynamical systems point of view is taken which recognizes such distributed nature of decisions and introduces novel modeling, control and protocol principles in support of system integration in time and space. In sharp contrast with the lack of theoretically-provable performance in the evolving electric power system architectures, this project explores fundamentals and takes major steps toward solving this long-overdue problem. The most important impact will be on the way electric power industry architectures evolve. In particular, the project will catalyze the adoption of data-enabled decision making and automation. Notably, this approach will help educate students to think about emerging electric energy systems as complex dynamical systems for which much innovation is needed and possible. Results of this research will be disseminated through a workshop on design and control of complex energy systems.\nFunding Agency: National Science Foundation\n","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"3af64834b88f29e7d8285107bea43ed2","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/project/eager/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/eager/","section":"project","summary":"The main objective of this project is to formalize ground-breaking general principles in support of investment planning and operating protocols for the changing electric energy systems.

The technique involves injecting a probe signal onto the grid to authenticate grid actions. The approach will include the real-time deployment of online computational algorithms in real-world critical locations. Partners include researchers from MIT, Texas A\u0026amp;M University, CenterPoint Energy, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). The MIT team will develop corrective control algorithms to mitigate the negative impact of cyber attacks. The figure below presents the topology of a test microgrid with the secondary control. The secondary controller aims to regulate voltage magnitude and frequency at one bus of the microgrid by tuning the setpoints of all inverters. An attacker can compromise the microgrid by maliciously manipulating the telemetered measurements feeding the secondary controller. If it happens, all decisions made by the secondary controller will be wrong. To enhance the cyber resilience of the microgrid, key questions include: 1) how to detect the cyber attacks; and 2) how to mitigate the negative impacts of cyber attacks if the attacks are detected. The project teams leverage a dynamic watermarking approach to detect the cyber attacks. The MIT team are designing an observer-based approach for taking corrective actions once attacks are detected. With the proposed corrective controller, critical electrical variables can still be regulated in the presence of cyber attacks.\nFunding Agency: US Department of Energy\n","date":1574268763,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574268763,"objectID":"35db677b7407e59bd2a7e6c61123e8d2","permalink":"https://mit-eesg.github.io/project/watermarking/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T12:52:43-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/watermarking/","section":"project","summary":"This project will develop and demonstrate an active defense mechanism of cyber-resilient PV distribution system operation using a dynamic watermarking technique to monitor cybersecurity.

Given this, SEPSS can emulate hybrid system dynamics driven by different inputs (weather, consumer preferences) and market decisions. Both Centralized and Distributed Automated Modeling of Power Systems (CAMPS, DAMPS) are possible. DAMPS is particularly well-suited for simulating utility scale systems and markets.\nWe demonstrate the basic Transactive Energy Market (TEM) concepts on truncated IEEE-8500 test system and some missing market signals.
